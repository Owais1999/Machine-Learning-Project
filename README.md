Spotify Recommendations:-  
we saw that the correlation between loudness and energy was high and correlation between loudness and accousticness was moderate rest all the correlation were quite low
also found that nowadays people like more loud and energetic songs and accorduing to these which song might be on the top list of spotify for a long time
if the loudness of the song is greater than -10dB than there is a chance of that song getting popular in the today's generation
and also got to know that nowadays people only listen to song that are about 3 to 4 mins long. if the song is above that time duration they simply dont listen or they just skip the song
after all the eda and model training we get the the conclusion is that the logistic regression model gives the best accuracy for this data set.
with the accuracy of 86% logistic regression givs the best accuracy
